## About the Video Course
PHP is the stepping stone to your first professional development gigs. PHP is the most popular back end language on the web.

Companies like Facebook and Tumblr use PHP as their primary back end coding language. It's in universal demands, and, as a new developer you're expected to know you're way around the front end and the back end. That's where PHP comes in.

There was a time when a web developer could get away with knowing just HTML and some JavaScript-- but now as employers are looking for more value, you have to know more. PHP lets you access an entire world of backend databases, like mySQL which is introduced in this course.
